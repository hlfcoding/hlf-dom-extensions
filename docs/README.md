# HLF jQuery Documentation

## Navigation

Use the 'Table of Contents' on the right to navigate. Pages are organized as
they are in the project's file structure. You can use search to quickly
navigate, for example query 'Tip' to find all tip-related documentation.

You'll also find links in the source files for the corresponding test files, and
vice versa, since the tests also serve as usage examples for the source.

## Generation

The docs use [Groc](http://nevir.github.io/groc) and are generated via:

```bash
grunt docs
```
